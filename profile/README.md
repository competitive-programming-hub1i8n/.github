**I'm Kevin**, and this is my **Competitive Programming Organization**.

Welcome to a space dedicated to solving algorithmic challenges and enhancing problem-solving skills through consistent practice and collaboration.

### ðŸ§© What you'll find here:
- âœ… Solutions to problems from platforms like **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, **AtCoder**, and more.
- ðŸ§  Well-structured and commented code to help with understanding core algorithms and data structures.
- ðŸ’¬ Occasionally, notes or strategies to approach certain problem types.

### ðŸ’» Programming Languages:
- ðŸŸ¡ **Java** â€“ for object-oriented solutions and system-level problems.
- ðŸ”µ **Python** â€“ for fast prototyping and concise, readable code.

### ðŸš€ Goals of the Organization:
- Promote a strong foundation in **competitive programming**.
- Share knowledge and techniques to help others grow.
- Build a repository of solved problems as a learning resource.
